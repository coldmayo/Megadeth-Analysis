# Megadeth-Analysis
My friend Paige once said that all Megadeth songs sound the same. This project will be used to prove her wrong. 


Potential Analysis Ideas:
Null Hypothesis Test:
  - evaluate difference in variation of pitch (standard deviations or something)
  - tempo differences (not sure how to detect that tho)
 
 Some time series analysis perhaps?
